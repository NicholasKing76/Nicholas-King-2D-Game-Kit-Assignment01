 I created stairs for the player to jump onto.
 
 I then made a moving platform that would allow 
 the player to traverse a gap without falling into a 
 pit with an enemy.
 
 I created a door for the player to open with a pressure plate.
 
 I created a pushable block for the player to push onto an enemy.
 
 Then I made a destructable wall for the player to break through.
 
 Then the player can push a block into a enemy to kill it while also
 using the block as a platform.
 
 The player then goes through a teleporter to a new area of the same scene
 and rides a moving platform up.
 
 They then crouch jump to get under a passable platform and destroy the two
 columns on the right.
 
 Then the player goes through another teleporter to a new scene.
 
 They then destroy another wall and pass through another platform.
 
 The player then reaches a purple portal and the level is over.
 
 There was no way to end a level so the portal is the end.
